# SRC++
A quality-of-life extension for [speedrun.com](speedrun.com).

## Features
* [Disable Custom Trophies](#disable-custom-trophies)
* [No User Badges and Gradients](#no-user-badges-and-gradients)

### Disable Custom Trophies
In addition to disabling custom leaderboard themes, disable custom trophies and instead see the site-wide defaults.

### No User Badges and Gradients
Username gradients and badges can be annoying; so get rid of them. Or optionally, get rid of badges just for those who aren't original donors.

### Consolidate Categories
Have miscellaneous categories displayed alongside the main categories instead of hidden behind an arbitrary "misc" dropdown. Or take it a step further, and have category extensions displayed on the main leaderboard.
